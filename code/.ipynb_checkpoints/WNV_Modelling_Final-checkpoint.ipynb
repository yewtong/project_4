    "### Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook aims to create models that will predict for the presence of WNV in a given mosquito population. Since WNV is not present 99.6% of the time, the imbalanced classes in our target variable posed our first challenge. As we will come to discover, our model is not sensitive to the presence of WNV and the general predictions from our model result in all negative predictions. From an accuracy stand-point, this may appear good. However, since there are no true positives and only false negatives, we incur Type II errors that are detrimental to our model's effectiveness to identify WNV outbreaks as they happen. As such, the AUC-ROC score is our metric of choice as it takes into account both specificity and recall.\n",
    "\n",
    "An AUC-ROC score of 0.5 is the worst possible score while an AUC-ROC score of 1.0 is the best possible. As we cross-validate and evaluate our models, we aim to maximise our AUC-ROC score. It is worthwhile to note that the Kaggle submission evaluates our predictions based on the AUC-ROC score of our predicition probabilities, whereas the AUC-ROC score we can evaluate our models on are based on the prediction outcomes (as we have no way of knowing the true prediction probabilities). This means that we can expect our AUC-ROC score on Kaggle to always be worse than our cross-validated AUC-ROC score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our baseline model and subsequent models were built using the Logistic Regression algorithm using just two features - Species and Traps. The prediction probabilities for a postive WNV outcome were found to be all less than 0.01. Since a positive WNV outcome will only be given when the probability is greater than 0.5, our model inevitably predicts 100% negative WNV outcomes with a poor AUC-ROC socre of 0.5. As we know this not to be true, we forced the predictions by lowering the threshold for a positive prediction. This was one method to deal with the problem of imbalanced classes. Support Vector Machine (SVM) was also attempted as a possible model, but to poor effect. For SVM, we used bootstrapping to create balanced classes to deal with the problem of imbalanced classes. The AUC-ROC score from SVM was poorer than Logistic Regression, thus we proceed with Logistic Regression for as our final model using our finetuned hyper-parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using our final model, we derived some insights about the features our model was trained on. Time was the most important feature to consider. This makes sense from our EDA as we see greatest spike in mosquito activity in the months of July and August, suggesting a seasonal pattern in mosquito population through the years. It can be assumed that with a greater mosquito population comes greater opportunities for the spread of WNV. The next most important feature is the species of mosquito. The top 2 carriers of the WNV are the Culex Pipiens and Restuans species.\n",

    "From this, we can draw some conclusions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The most important factor determining whether a trap had WNV was the time of year. The further away from August, the less likely there is to be WNV, most likely because there are less mosquitoes (as per the EDA). July also affects it but we can see that August works better, likely because this is the peak.\n",
    "- Following this, the next most important feature is the type of species, most notably Culex Pipiens and Resuans. These are the most likely to have WNV. The other species means it's less likely (most likely because if it's Culex Erraticus, for example, it's not Culex Pipiens/Restuans)\n",
    "- The greater the snowfall, the less likely WNV is present. Greater snowfall indicates low temperatures, which suggests that low temperature results in a lower probability of observing the WNV.\n",
    "- Greater average wind speed will result in a greater incidence of WNV observations. This can be attributed to relatively lower humidity levels on a more windy day.\n",
    "- Traps T900, T225, etc are the most likely to have WNV, these are also the areas most likely to have WNV.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that a lot of these factors would probably predict the number of mosquitoes too. If there is more snow, it makes sense that there are less mosquitoes. However, we also know from the EDA that while the number of mosquitoes is somewhat correlated with the presence of WNV, this correlation isn't that strong.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we can say with some certainty that these coefficients determine how these variables affect the presence of WNV. It isn't just the number of mosquitoes."

    "From our logistic regression model, the single most important factor to predicting the presence of WNV was time. To be more specific, relative time from our hypothesised peak of August. The further the time period is from August, the less the incidence of observing WNV. This is likely also because the mosquito population is smaller as per our EDA findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../assets/Probability of species with virus.png\" width=\"700\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The next most important factor is the type of mosquito species, most notably Culex Pipiens and Restuans. These species appear to be the greatest carrier of the WNV. Temperature and humidity are also important factors to consider. Snowfall and average wind speeds were among the top predictors for the presence of the WNV. Finally, location is also important. Hotspots are bound by proximity and the mosquitoes are only vectors for the WNV that is spread when the mosquito takes the blood of a person already infected with the WNV. Thus, certain traps are top predictors for WNV as they indicate the hotspots.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../assets/location trap and spray all year.png\" width=\"700\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the above conclusion, we make the following **recommedations**:\n",
    "- Spraying should be done before and up till August each year. Both EDA and our model suggest that the mosquito population and mosquito carrying virus tends to peak before August. Therefore, spraying would be most effective if it was done before August. After August, the mosquito population begins to dwindle.\n",
    "- There might be value to studying the genetic make up of species Culex Pipiens and Restuans, and to manufacture spraying chemicals that could more effectively target Culex Pipiens and Restuans as they are the greatest carrier of the virus.\n",
    "- Our model has revealed that the greater the snowfall, the less likely that WNV will be present. Areas/periods that had snowed will have a lower priority for spraying. The budget for spraying can be saved for when WNV will be/going to be most prevalent.\n",
    "- During periods that with greater average wind speeds (and therefore less humid), incidence of WNV goes up. Intervention is recommended during these periods, but the efficacy of spraying on a windy day has to be studied further.\n",
    "- Areas in the vicinity of traps T900 and T225 will need to be more thoroughly sprayed as these traps observed the greatest incidence of WNV-carrying mosquitoes.\n",
